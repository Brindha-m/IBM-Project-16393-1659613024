## Data Collection

Collecting the required data is the beginning of the whole process. Data repository has the repository of all the data related to weather conditions and power generated. The data which is used to train the model is obtained from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to do this analysis.

The dataset contains the details about 
                                       
                                       
                                       ✅Air temperature (°C),
                                       
                                       ✅Timestamp,
                                       
                                       ✅Pressure (atm), 
                                       
                                       ✅Wind direction (deg),
                                       
                                       ✅Wind speed (m/s) and
                                       
                                       ✅Power generated by the system (kW).
