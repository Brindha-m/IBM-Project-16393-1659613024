# Model Building

## Choose The Appropriate Model
 Model used is a special kind of RNN 
                               
                               ⚙️  BiLSTM Network (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) ⚙️ 
                               
                              

An BiLSTM is well suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events.

BiLSTM plays a prominent performance in capturing the long-term dependencies along the time steps, and thus very applicable for wind power prediction.

      Using Openweather API we can access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities!
 
      We collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites,
      radars and a vast network of weather stations.
   
      Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.
